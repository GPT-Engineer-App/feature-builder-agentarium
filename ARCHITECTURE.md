# CodeGenie AI Architecture

This document outlines the architecture and implementation details of CodeGenie AI.

## Core Components

* **User Interface (UI):** Provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with CodeGenie AI. This includes features for providing prompts, reviewing generated code, and managing projects.
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Engine:** Processes user prompts and translates them into actionable tasks for the AI agents.
* **AI Agent Manager:** Orchestrates the activities of multiple AI agents, assigning tasks and managing resources.
* **Code Generation AI Agent:** Specializes in generating code in various programming languages based on the specifications provided by the NLP engine.
* **Testing AI Agent:** Responsible for automatically testing the generated code to ensure functionality and identify potential issues.
* **Deployment AI Agent:** Handles the deployment of the application to the desired platform.
* **Knowledge Base:** A repository of information about various programming languages, frameworks, and best practices. This knowledge base is used by the AI agents to inform their decisions and generate high-quality code.

## Workflow

1. The user provides a prompt describing the desired application through the UI.
2. The NLP engine processes the prompt and extracts key information.
3. The AI Agent Manager assigns tasks to the appropriate AI agents based on the extracted information.
4. The Code Generation AI Agent generates the initial codebase.
5. The Testing AI Agent automatically tests the generated code.
6. The Deployment AI Agent prepares the application for deployment.
7. The user reviews the generated code and provides feedback.
8. The AI agents iterate on the code based on the user's feedback.
9. The final application is deployed to the desired platform.

## Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** React, JavaScript
* **Backend:** Python, Flask
* **AI Models:** Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3, Codex, etc.
* **Database:** MongoDB

## Future Enhancements

* **Integration with more development tools and platforms.**
* **Support for more programming languages and frameworks.**
* **Improved AI model performance and accuracy.**
* **Enhanced user interface and experience.**

This architecture is designed to be scalable and adaptable to future advancements in AI technology.
